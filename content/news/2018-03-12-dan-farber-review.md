# Going Private: Climate Action by Businesses and Individuals

This is a review of a new book by Michael Vandenbergh and Jonathan Gilligan, 
_Beyond Politics: The Private Governance Response to Climate Change_. 
They make a persuasive case that private initiatives in this area have been underestimated. 
The review seeks to build on their analysis in two ways. 
First, it examines what features of private action make it more or less a form of "governance," and it suggests some 
ways the private sector could move further toward regulatory governance. 
Second, it considers ways to expand synergies between private action and governmental efforts. 
If, as seems likely, climate action is likely to be as much bottom-up as top-down, it is important to explore how the 
private sector can contribute to this effort.
