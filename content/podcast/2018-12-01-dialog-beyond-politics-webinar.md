# Introduction

When the United States withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement, 100 private 
corporations reaffirmed their commitment to fighting climate change. While 
governments are often the tasked with facing climate change, many major private 
institutions are taking steps to significantly reduce carbon emissions reaping 
the benefits of favorable public image and reduced operational costs from energy
and other savings. While private action alone will not be sufficient to address 
climate change, it can buy time while government policy plans are developed and 
enacted and can significantly add to the collective mitigation efforts. 
In their new book, _Beyond Politics_, Michael Vandenbergh and Jonathan Gilligan 
argue that private climate initiatives could reduce carbon emissions by up to 
one billion tons per year over the next ten years. Vandenbergh and Gilligan 
identify current initiatives and explore future pathways for private climate action, 
including public and private synergies for climate mitigation and approaches for 
evaluating the effectiveness of private action. Co-authors Michael Vandenbergh and 
Jonathan Gilligan, as well as our leading co-panelists, discussed the role of 
private institutions in climate change mitigation. They discussed the incentives 
for private actors pursuing carbon reduction initiatives, key factors in successful 
case studies, and methods for developing and evaluating successful private 
climate initiatives.
