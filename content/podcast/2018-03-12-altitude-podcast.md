# This is Beyond Politics

Two Vanderbilt professors are taking a creative approach to solving climate change. Our guests, Michael Vandenbergh and Jonathan Gilligan recently released a new book Beyond Politics, discussing the role private entities can play in reducing carbon emissions even without the US government taking action. They tell us how we can make a meaningful difference by changing our behavior at home. US households emit as many carbon emissions as all of the countries in South America combined.
