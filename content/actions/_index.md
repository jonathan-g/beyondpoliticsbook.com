title: "What Can Individuals Do?"

This section presents a list of actions that individuals can do to reduce their
greenhouse gas emissions, encourage others to do likewise, and promote emissions
reductions through private governance.

These recommendations provide a pathway to help you reduce your carbon
footprint. Although we recommend starting with a
focused effort on the most promising behaviors, you
should not get discouraged if you are not perfect or if you can only take small
initial steps.

Remember that **_what you do will affect those around you, too_**.
If you are in the US, multiply every step you take by 330 million
to get a sense of the effect that your behavior would have if everyone did what
you do.

The most important thing, regardless whether you start big or start small,
is to **_get started_**.

If you have new ideas for reducing greenhouse gas emissions through
private governance in the corporate, household, or non-profit sectors,
please send your ideas to
