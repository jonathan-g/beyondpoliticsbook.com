# Beyond Politics: A Private Governance Approach to Climate Change

With President Trump's announcement to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement, many other countries around the world---and cities and states within the U.S.---are stepping up their commitments to address climate change.

But one thing is clear: Even if all the remaining participating nations do their part, governments alone can't substantially reduce the risk of catastrophic climate change.

We've studied the role of the private sector in addressing climate change, and we're convinced that the next stage is going to require more than just political agreement. What is needed is a concerted effort to mobilize private action---not just corporations but also religious and civic organizations, colleges and universities, investors and households---to help narrow the gap that remains after the Paris Agreement.
