This chapter argues that understanding the role of private initiatives can unlock many new opportunities.

It suggests a strategic assessment to identify the most promising new private governance initiatives. A new, non-aligned organization may be necessary to attract support from moderates and conservatives, coordinate among existing initiatives and launch new ones. Greater coordination also could occur among existing organizations, though, and regardless of the form it will be important to track and report on emissions reductions. The chapter then suggests additional private climate governance initiatives, including initiatives that target new actors, such as the religious, insurance, and small business sectors. For instance, the Catholic Church would be one of the top 50 emitters if it were a country and could commit to reducing its emissions in addition to advocating for government action. The chapter also suggests potential new actions, such as increasing the priority given to climate in existing private governance initiatives, expansion of efforts to increase corporate demand for renewable power, expansion of commodity roundtables, creation of new household initiatives that change default settings, and others. The chapter concludes by arguing that the new initiatives discussed in the chapter are just the tip of the iceberg.
