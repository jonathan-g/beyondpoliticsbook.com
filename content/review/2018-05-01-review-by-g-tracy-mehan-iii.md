# Mixing Private Action and Climate Policy

Distinguishing government
from governance, identifying
the separate yet complementary
roles of the private and public
spheres, say, in the realm of environmental
management, and thinking
seriously about the opportunities
and barriers of an integrated or collaborative
approach to confronting
the challenges of the day---none of
this would have made any sense to a
citizen of the Roman Empire in the
time of Augustus.

The classical view did not recognize
anything like civil society beyond the
Empire itself encompassing both political,
social and religious
aspects. It was only after
centuries of struggle between
Church and Empire, state
and society, and the emergence
of varying degrees of
individualism, did the concept
of a civil order and institutions
(church, family,
community, labor unions,
corporations), antecedent to
and independent of the state,
come to pass.

Without civil society, government
and governance are
essentially the same. With
civil society government is simply part
of the complex web of governance by
which a society orders itself as well as
the state. Thus, no longer is governance
viewed as a synonym for government.
The late Elinor Ostrom of Indiana
University, the first woman to receive
the Nobel Prize in economics, did
pioneering research on a plethora of
collaborative approaches to resource
management---governance if you
will---around the world in ways that
mitigate the Tragedy of the Commons
not imagined by Garrett Hardin, who
reduced everything to either regulation
or privatization. She demonstrated that
user-managed fish stocks, pastures,
woods, lakes, and groundwater basins,
in many countries and cultures, are able
to establish norms of behavior, sophisticated
rules for decisionmaking, and
even enforcement mechanisms. Her
classic book on the subject is _Governing
the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions
for Collective Actions_ (1990).

Given the state of environmental
protection today, with many problems
dispersed throughout society, the landscape,
the air- and watershed, involving
numerous small sources or causes of
harm, all within the control of private
parties, households, farms and institutions,
the old top-down, hierarchical
model, driven by a federal government
much less revered now than in the
1970s, seems inadequate.

Writing in 1997, Daniel Esty and
Marian R. Chertow of Yale, called for
the "next generation" of environmental
policies "that are not confrontational
but cooperative, less fragmented and
more comprehensive, not inflexible
but rather capable of being tailored to
fit varying circumstances." See introduction
to _Thinking Ecologically: The
Next Generation of Environmental Policy_
(1997). They noted the value of keeping
pace with the important elements
of "institutional realignment that are
occurring in society. Notably, the role
of government is narrowing, the private
sector’s responsibilities are broadening,
and nongovernmental organizations,
from think tanks to activist groups, are
increasingly important policy actors."

Michael P. Vandenbergh and Jonathan
M. Gilligan, respectively, professors
of law and engineering at Vanderbilt
University, argue strenuously for
private action and governance specifically,
in the context of the climate
change and the flagging efforts of
governments, especially the United
States, to take meaningful action. They
are not anti-governmental action. But
they believe that time is flying and private
action provides a realistic, interim
strategy until an effective political
consensus develops before catastrophe
befalls the world. Their _Beyond Politics:
The Private Governance
Response to Climate Change_
is an imposing work of academic
scholarship (e.g., over
200 footnotes in one chapter
alone). But their engaging,
accessible writing style makes
the slog a pleasant one for the
diligent reader. It might have
been subtitled Making a Virtue
of Necessity given the realities
of climate politics, global
aspirations for economic
growth, and the complexity
of the science.

In the very first line of
their preface, Vandenbergh and Gilligan
cite Gallup for the proposition that
two thirds of Americans believe that
big government is the greatest threat
facing the United States. So any systematic
regulation to mitigate climate
change faces predictable resistance. The
authors seem to believe that the Trump
administration’s rollback on carbon
regulation is a temporary phenomenon,
but they astutely observe that the
2009 Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade
bill failed "even though the party that
espouses support for climate mitigation
controlled the White House and
both bodies of Congress---a failure
that seems remarkable until it is viewed
against the backdrop of two decades
with only one major new pollution
control statute."

"Only in the past several years have
scholars begun to recognize that a fundamental
shift has occurred away from
federal legislation as a social response
to environmental threats, a shift that
became much more apparent with
the 2016 elections," write the authors.
They might also have noted the 1997
vote of 95--0 in favor of the Byrd-Hagel
Resolution in the U.S. Senate against
signing onto the Kyoto Protocol.

Vandenbergh and Gilligan make a
sincere, passionate, even eloquent case
to both conservative and liberal skeptics,
the former skeptical as to climate
policy in general and big government
in particular, the latter concerned
about undermining the case of strong
governmental action on climate.

Essentially, these authors see zero
chance of the community of nations
meeting the goal of stabilizing global
temperature at 2 degrees
Celsius as called
for in the Paris Agreement.
"In fact, the
Paris Agreement, even
if all commitments
are fulfilled, will allow
an increase in global
emissions of roughly 34 to 46 percent
in 2025 over 1990 levels." Even with
full implementation of all Paris commitments,
the globe is likely to see
temperatures of more than 3 degrees
Celsius above pre-industrial ones.

The Vanderbilt professors look to
private action to achieve "a significant
fraction of the necessary reductions
— carbon dioxide emissions equivalent
to roughly 1 billion tons out of
the 5.5 billion tons per year of reductions
necessary over the next decade
to close the Paris Gap." They view this
strategy as "buying time for a more
comprehensive government response"
at some indeterminate point in the future,
presumably post-Trump. They do
not posit "an all-or-nothing argument
that the world must choose between
public and private governance. In our
view, they are complementary, and we
should pursue both."

The authors cite many instances
of effective private action,
notably major institutions
and corporations such as Walmart,
Microsoft, Google, and the like, corporate
giants which can lean on their
suppliers for emission reductions,
practices that could be scaled up
nationally and internationally. They
take heart in Elinor Ostrom’s concept
of "polycentric governance to
reduce GHG emissions" which she
first applied to the management of
water resources and the provision of
municipal services. This refers to the
use of multiple scales of government
and nongovernmental organizations
to address collective action problems,
such as managing common pool resources.

Readers of _The Environmental
Forum_ may recall Professor Vandenbergh’s
article, "The
Drivers of Corporate
Climate Mitigation,"
in the January/February
issue, providing a
succinct statement of
the case for private action
in that realm.

Big fans of Pope Francis and his
2016 encyclical addressing the moral
dimension of climate change, they
view the Catholic Church as not just an
influencer on government, but also "a
private regulator of its energy suppliers
and emissions in and of itself." Based
on their back-of-the-envelope calculations,
Catholicism, with its many
churches, schools, hospitals, orphanages,
and missions, would be among the
top 50 largest emitters in the world if it
were a country. Whether or not such a
vast collection of bishoprics, dioceses,
religious orders, lay institutions, and
the like could ever be subject to such
centralized management, not withstanding
its unity of doctrine and practice,
it is an interesting thought experiment,
as the Germans say.

Vandenbergh and Gilligan aim to
ground their optimism on sound reasoning,
to wit: "Our view that many
households and corporations will respond
to private initiatives by reducing
emissions does not require unrealistic
assumptions about altruism. Instead,
the opportunity arises because private
initiatives can stimulate efficiency improvements
that have not yet been
exploited because of market and behavioral
failures. Private initiatives also
can draw on existing levels of support
for climate mitigation in ways that governments
cannot. These initiatives also
can address solution aversion among
moderates and conservatives, bypassing
resistance to government climate
efforts that arises from concerns about
big government. At the international
level, private governance initiatives can
supplement the slow and cumbersome
international negotiations process. Private
initiatives also can harness supply
chains to transfer pressure for lowercarbon
goods and services across international
boundaries, circumventing
sovereignty and free-trade concerns and
increasing support for mitigation in developed
and developing countries."

The "principal barrier" is "conceptual,"
i.e., "the need for opinion leaders,
corporate and NGO leaders, and
philanthropists to grasp the magnitude
of the opportunities available to them."

_Beyond Politics_ is provocative and
challenging, well-sourced and full of
insights as to motivational approaches
to household and institutional behavior.
Yet, no where in the dozen or so
pages of the book’s index will the reader
find any references to either adaptation
or resilience in the face of climate
change. The authors chose to focus exclusively
on mitigation. Society, however,
may be forced to consider other
options given the stark political and
economic realities of climate policy.
