"_Beyond Politics: The Private Governance Response to Climate Change_ is an imposing work of academic scholarship.... But [the] engaging, accessible writing style makes the slog a pleasant one for the diligent reader. Vandenbergh and Gilligan make a sincere, passionate, even eloquent case to both conservative and liberal skeptics, the former skeptical as to climate policy in general and big government in particular, the latter concerned about undermining the case of strong governmental action on climate."
