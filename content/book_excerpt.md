Who recently announced a goal of reducing 20 million metric tons of greenhouse
gas emissions? We have posed that question to dozens of audiences at public
events and in university classrooms, and the answers we get invariably assume
that government is the actor.

In some cases, the answers are cities like Seattle and New York. In other cases,
the answers point to states and provinces like Rhode Island and British Columbia,
or countries ranging from China to small island states.

The correct answer? 
[Walmart](https://news.walmart.com/2017/04/19/walmart-launches-project-gigaton-to-reduce-emissions-in-companys-supply-chain). 
Working with the Environmental Defense Fund, in
2010 Walmart announced the 20 million-ton goal, and the effort ultimately
yielded more than 28 million tons of emissions reductions between 2010 and 2015
from Walmart’s suppliers in China and around the world. Moreover, on the heels
of this achievement, Walmart announced the 
[even more ambitious goal](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/why-walmarts-project-gigaton-corporate-americas-moonshot)
of reducing
its greenhouse gas emissions between 2015 and 2030 by 1 billion tons, which
would be roughly the same reduction that would be achieved by a government
regulation that required the U.S. iron and steel industry to cut its emissions
to zero.

Whatever your views are about Walmart, we suspect that taking a leading role in
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions is not the role you envisioned for the
company. We examine why climate debates so often default to an assumption that
government must be the actor that responds to climate change and that the action
must be some form of international agreement, or domestic law, policy or program.

Although the climate problem will not be solved without government responses,
we demonstrate that private actors --- including corporations, advocacy groups,
individuals and households, civic, cultural, philanthropic and religious
organizations, universities and hospitals --- are achieving major emissions
reductions in the United States and around the globe. We explain why they are
acting, and we identify additional opportunities that could add up to a billion
tons per year of additional emissions reductions over the next decade.

A focus on actions by the private sector is particularly important because
climate policy is deeply polarized along liberal and conservative lines, but
private sector responses, which we call private climate governance, can bypass
"[solution aversion](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9d88/a3565d94463eb9f197b92a95d9140c3e3576.pdf)" 
--- the resistance to climate change that arises from
concerns about a big government response. A billion tons of emissions reductions
per year over the next decade will not solve the climate problem, but these
reductions will buy additional time for public opinion and public support to
catch up with the climate science.

Corporate climate initiatives such as the Walmart example are the most visible
example of private governance, and these initiatives have proliferated in the
U.S. and around the world in the last decade.

Walkers Crisps, the largest potato chip producer in the United Kingdom, feeling
pressure to examine its carbon footprint, has learned that because it was buying
potatoes by the pound, farmers were responding by picking the potatoes when they
were wet and storing them in humidified warehouses, only to have the company dry
them before it turned them into potato chips. This process boosted energy costs
and carbon emissions, and wasted money.

Apple has pushed for lower carbon emissions from its suppliers in China, and to
address concerns that the suppliers could not reduce their carbon footprint
because they could only buy coal-fired electricity, in 2015 Apple partnered with
its suppliers to provide two gigawatts of renewable energy (the equivalent of
roughly two to four major electric power plants) to these suppliers. In 2016,
Apple took a similar step in Arizona, committing to build a major new solar
power plant to offset the emissions from a new manufacturing facility.

In the United States, Microsoft, Google and dozens of other major companies have
publicly committed to become carbon-neutral. Hundreds of others have committed
to less ambitious but still important emissions reduction goals. For instance,
Dell Computer has committed to 30 percent carbon emissions reductions. Some of
these actions may have been taken in anticipation of near-term government
regulations that look increasingly unlikely, at least in the United States, but
many clearly are not the product of near-term government pressure.

Recent developments in our area, the U.S. Southeast, provide an example. The
southeastern states would be the 
[sixth largest emitter](https://www.southernenvironment.org/our-programs/clean-energy-and-air)
if they were a country,
and these states are not known as leaders in climate policy. Most have not only
rejected state climate regulations, but also have litigated vigorously to prevent
the federal government from enforcing national regulations that would reduce
emissions from coal-fired power plants. Although these states are not pursuing
carbon emissions reductions, Google, Facebook, and other companies are pushing
utilities in the region to provide renewable energy for new facilities such as
data centers and are extending their influence by encouraging other electricity
buyers to do the same.

It is easy to fall into the trap of assuming that the only important climate
policy question, as one leading pundit suggested, is "What can government do?"
Even our vocabulary, ranging from terms such as "policymaker" to "regulation"
and "international," can create a conceptual trap, implying that government is
the actor that can respond to social problems. Instead of asking "What can
government do?" in this book we ask, “What can any organization do?” To avoid
the vocabulary trap, when talking about private governance we use broad terms
such as "actor" and "initiative" in place of "policymaker" and "regulation."
These terms may seem too generic, but they can accommodate the large variety of
private climate actors and actions, and most alternative terms tend to reinforce
the government-as-actor framing.

Re-framing the question to leave room for private governance leads to several
additional conceptual shifts. The actor that can drive emissions reductions
shifts from government alone to any public or private organization. In turn,
the actions that can be taken expand from government laws, policies and programs
to include a number of private options as well, such as supply chain contracting
requirements, private certification standards for forestry and other
carbon-intensive sectors, commodity roundtables, lender standards, corporate
and product carbon disclosure, green finance, private sector demand for renewable
power, employee household efficiency campaigns, household energy disclosure, and
a host of others. Even the conception of emissions sources shifts, since private
actors and initiatives can reach many types of sources that are difficult for
government to regulate, including households, small businesses, foreign
businesses, religious organizations, universities, hospitals, and civic and
cultural organizations.

We make the case that governments are not the only important actors for climate
mitigation. Private actors, including corporations, advocacy groups, individuals
and households, civic, cultural, philanthropic and religious organizations,
universities and hospitals are not just advocates for or against government
action, but they can make an important, and perhaps essential, contribution on
their own. In other words, addressing climate change requires more than just
government action; a concerted effort is needed to mobilize private actors to
reduce their emissions and push other private organizations to do so as well.

Our analysis suggests that private climate initiatives in the corporate and
household sectors alone can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by roughly a billion
tons per year over the next decade, on top of the emissions reductions that
could be achieved from government climate policies. These private sector-driven
emissions reductions are not enough by themselves to limit global warming to
3 degrees Celsius, much less 2&deg;C or 1.5&deg;C, but they can be an important piece of
a larger strategy to buy time, improve the odds of avoiding catastrophic climate
change, and reduce the costs and intrusiveness of emissions reductions. Even
after governments adopt additional policies, private governance can play a
complementary role, providing additional information and motivation to achieve
emissions reductions.

Can private actions yield sufficiently large emissions reductions to be worth the
effort? Our research suggests that private climate governance is not a sideshow
but is one of the few ways to bypass government gridlock and achieve major
emissions reductions over the next decade. International, national and
sub-national actions are obviously important, but private initiatives already are
reducing annual global emissions by millions of tons through the individual and
collective actions of corporations, private certification and standards groups,
advocacy groups, religious organizations, universities, households, and other
actors typically viewed as lobbyists for or against government action, not as
important players directly in climate mitigation.

The conceptual shift regarding climate actors, actions and sources makes it
possible to appreciate the extent of the efforts that are under way and to
envision a private climate governance strategy that can bypass government
gridlock at the international, national and sub-national levels. In this new
vision, the Catholic Church and other not-for-profit organizations are important
sources and regulators of their contractors’ emissions, not just advocates for
government action. Corporations are regulators of their suppliers, of their
borrowers, of their commercial tenants, and sometimes of their corporate
customers, not just regulatory targets or lobbyists.

The amount of private climate governance activity under way now is remarkable.
But to see the significance of these initiatives, we need a conceptual framework
that does not exclude private actions from our notions of governance.

We develop that conceptual framework in this book and outline a private climate
governance strategy by defending three propositions. First, we demonstrate that
large emissions reductions are needed in the near term. Second, we explain why
it is unrealistic to assume that governments will be able to deliver the needed
reductions. Third, we demonstrate how private climate governance can achieve a
significant fraction of the necessary reductions --- carbon dioxide emissions
equivalent to roughly 1 billion tons.

Private governance is not enough to solve the climate problem, but it can
contribute to buying time for a more comprehensive government response, reduce
the risk of catastrophic climate change, and reduce the cost of climate
mitigation. We do not pose an all-or-nothing argument that the world must choose
between public and private governance. In our view, they are complementary, and
we should pursue both.
